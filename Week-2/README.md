# Variables
- variables are the container that is used to store data temporarily.
- Variables is a symbolic name that refers to data.it can hold manay values
  but at a time it can hold only one value. 
- Data store in memory (memory means RAM).
# Example of variable code
## Creating Veriable As String

```
Name="Atta Ur Rehman"
print(Name)
```
## Type of given data
```
type(Name)
```
## Finding Id or Address of storing data
```
id(Name)
```
## Creating Veriable As number/Integer

```
Num= 20
print(Num)
```
## Type of given data
```
type(Num)
```
## Finding Id or Address of storing data
```
id(Num)
```

## Creating Veriable As Float
```
Weight= 20.2
print(Weight)
```
## Type of given data
```
type(Weight)
```
## Finding Id or Address of storing data
```
id(Weight)
```

# Datatypes
```
Integers -->
``` 
Numbers
``` eg. 23
Decimal --> ````Float```` eg. 12.4
Character --> ````string```` eg. "Atta"
Binary 0/1 OR True/False --> ````Boolean```` eg. True/False 
```
