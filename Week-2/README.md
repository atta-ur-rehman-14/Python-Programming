# Variables
- variables are the container that is used to store data temporarily.
- Variables is a symbolic name that refers to data.it can hold manay values
  but at a time it can hold only one value. 
- Data store in memory (memory means RAM).
# Example of variable code
## Creating Veriable As String

```
Name="Atta Ur Rehman"
print(Name)
```
## Type of given data
```
type(Name)
```
## Finding Id or Address of storing data
```
id(Name)
```
## Creating Veriable As number/Integer

```
Num= 20
print(Num)
```
## Type of given data
```
type(Num)
```
## Finding Id or Address of storing data
```
id(Num)
```

## Creating Veriable As Float
```
Weight= 20.2
print(Weight)
```
## Type of given data
```
type(Weight)
```
## Finding Id or Address of storing data
```
id(Weight)
```

# Datatypes
 Datatype specify the value of data that variable hold.That is use to perform operation

- Integers -->  ````Numbers```` eg. 23
- Decimal --> ````Float```` eg. 12.4
- Character --> ````string```` eg. "Atta"
- Binary 0/1 OR True/False --> ````Boolean```` eg. True/False 

### Apply all these steps/Rules on diffferen data types ( string, integer, float, bool)

- creating a variable eg: variable_name = variable_value 
- printing that variable eg: print(variable_name) 
- check the type of variable eg: type(variable_name) 
- check the address of the variable eg: id(variable_name)

## Creating Veriable As Boolean
```
boolean_var=True
print(boolean_var)
```
## Type of given data
```
type(boolean_var)
```
## Finding Id or Address of storing data
```
id(boolean_var)
```
## Creating Veriable As Boolean
```
boolean_var=False
print(boolean_var)
```
## Type of given data
```
type(boolean_var)
```
## Finding Id or Address of storing data
```
id(boolean_var)
```
